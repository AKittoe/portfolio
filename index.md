# Bio

16ms is the portfolio of media artist and technologist Michael Walczyk. He works primarily with code and tangible media. His work explores topology, connectedness, dimensionality (expansion and reduction), and space. 

He is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Digital Media Design program, an interdisciplinary major that blends computer science and art. He also minored in music. He proudly attended the spring 2015 session of The School for Poetic Computation: an artist run school in NYC that explores the intersections of hardware, code, and poetry. He recently finished a 3-year stint as an interactive developer at Obscura Digital in San Francisco.

In his free time, he likes to practice sitar, read math textbooks, and create music.
