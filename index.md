### Bio

I am a media artist and graphics programmer currently based in Portland, Oregon. I build custom software and esoteric tools to explore topology, connectedness, dimensionality (expansion and reduction), and space. Currently, I'm interested in computational origami, knot theory, and folding.

I graduated from the Digital Media Design program at the University of Pennsylvania, an interdisciplinary major that blends computer science and art. I also minored in music. I attended the spring 2015 session of The School for Poetic Computation: an artist run school in NYC that explores the intersections of hardware, code, and poetry. Recently, I finished a 3-year stint as an interactive developer at Obscura Digital in San Francisco and now work as an independent contractor and consultant.

In my free time, I like to practice sitar, fold origami, read math textbooks, and create electronic music.

These are a few of the projects I have worked on. I also post (a ton of) experiments and works-in-progress on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mwalczyk/) account.
